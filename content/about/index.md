Hello! I'm Chuang Liu, a master's student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, passionate about modern storage engines and distributed systems. I have experience in industrial software development and particularly interested in KV storage engines like LevelDB, Redis, and Etcd. 

I’m eager to bring my energy and expertise to a Software Development Intern role, where I can help create innovative systems that make life better for both users and developers. My dream is to design game-changing solutions that leave a lasting impact.

As a self-driven and collaborative problem-solver, I thrive in teamwork and love tackling challenges. When I’m not coding, I’m into working out, badminton, exploring photography, and vibing to rock and R&B (with *[David Tao](https://open.spotify.com/album/4dKxGaRsGhkpzR58DGh5rq)* as a top pick). I’m also a fan of RPG games, with *[Xenogears](https://xenosaga.fandom.com/wiki/Xenogears)* holding a special place in my heart.
